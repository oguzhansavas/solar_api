# Getting Started

> **Note**: This post is pinned and is meant to be an introductory guide to the Chirpy theme.

## Prerequisites

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

## Installation

There are two ways to get the theme:

- **[Fork on GitHub][fork]** - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing.
- **[Download from GitHub][download]** - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade.

### Option 1. Fork on GitHub

Sign in to GitHub and [fork **Chirpy**][fork], then clone the fork to your local machine:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/jekyll-theme-chirpy.git
```

Where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username.

### Option 2. GitHub Fork

If you prefer to customize the theme heavily, you can [download the latest release][download] and unzip it to a local directory.

Then install the dependencies:

```console
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Please see the [theme's docs][docs].
